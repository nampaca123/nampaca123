Backend developer building with **Java/Kotlin** and **JavaScript**. Shipped production systems at [**Bestia Group**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bestia-group-llc) (PropTech startup, Los Angeles) and [**FPT Software**](https://fptsoftware.com) (IT enterprise, Vietnam). Deeply interested in financial IT — I hold a **Certified Investment Manager** license alongside my engineering background, and I'm currently building a Python/ML-powered quant investment system to put that interest into practice.

### CAFE

> The four pillars behind [**KNN Cafe**](https://www.kyounginn.com), my portfolio — and the lens through which I approach every project.
